## [SAMIHS: Adaptation of Segment Anything Model for Efficient Intracranial Hemorrhage Segmentation]
#### by Yinuo Wang, Kai Chen, Weimin Yuan, Cai Meng, Xiangzhi Bai

This repository provides a PyTorch implementation of our work submited at ISBI 2024 -->

## Overview
- **Model**: SAMIHS: A parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method 
- **Task**: To adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to intracranial hemorrhage segmentation.
- **Ideas**ï¼šThe parameter-refactoring adapters and boundary-sensitive loss are incorporated in SAMIHS to improve both efficiency and accuracy.

## Updates

- 2023.11.13: Code released.
